 
- Modify the DpDataQueue object to actually store things in chunks so that 
  when it is pulling data out of the queue when there is a LOT of data in 
  it, it can be at least somewhat efficient.  The rotating queue that 
  expands would probably work.  A linked list of queue chunks could be 
  used.  If a smaller peice is needed than what is in the first chunk, then 
  grab that peice of data and resize the first chunk.  When inserting data, 
  make a copy of the chunk of data being added, and then add that pointer to 
  the end of the list.  This should hopefully improve performance a bit when 
  using the queue for high-speed data communications.
