This folder should contain documents about the design of DevPlus.  This is not the place 
for user documentation or manuals.  It is for the development OF devplus, not for 
development WITH devplus.

User documentation should go in:
   src/current/docs/

Need to write up some instructions on how to produce the newer updated releases.
